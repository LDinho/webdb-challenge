1. Explain the difference between RDBMS and SQL.

     - RDBM (Relational Database Management System) is the database software that manages storage, querying and updating of data.
      SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language used to manipulate data in the RDBMS.

  2. Why do tables need a primary key?

      - Primary Keys uniquely identifies each record in a table. It helps to define relationships between tables as foreign keys.

  3. What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.

     - Foreign Key

  4. What do we need in order to have a many to many relationship between two tables.

     - We would create a junction table that manages the foreign keys between two tables.
